## Abstract
A major challenge in analysing laboratory experiments with unmarked animals is being able to tell which animal is which at any given moment and over time. We explore the effectiveness of Deep Learning techniques for identifying laboratory rats, by training and testing Convolutional Neural Networks and other models on a dataset of 1.44 million images of 16 rats under controlled conditions. Establishing the first baseline for unmarked animal identification in behavioural research.
We evaluate the scalability of these techniques and examine how image properties and learning parameters influence their performance. Our results demonstrate that the identification accuracy can exceed 90% for a moderate number of individuals without using additional knowledge such as heuristics or body part information. However, they also cast doubt on widely accepted claims in the scientific literature that Deep Learning techniques can reliably distinguish up to 100 unmarked animals in experimental settings.
