## Abstract
We study the performance of Deep Learning techniques for the identification of rats under laboratory conditions. With the purpose of establishing a baseline for the computational analysis of group experiments when it comes to ensuring that the collected data correspond to the correct animal over time. To address this, we established a robust framework to evaluate models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Experiments involved 1.44 million images from 16 rats under controlled conditions, testing the impact of preprocessing (e.g. resolution, color space) and scalability. Results highlight the superiority of CNNs, particularly the ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to 93\% accuracy with frame sequences, surpassing single-frame analysis. While preprocessing decisions significantly influenced outcomes, data augmentation yielded limited benefits. This work provides a benchmark for applying deep learning in animal identification, offering insights for future improvements and applications in behavioral research
